// "The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[8] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[8][9] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered."

// "In an anonymous footnote to his 1766 translation of Charles Bonnet's Contemplation de la Nature, the astronomer Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg noted an apparent pattern in the layout of the planets, now known as the Titius-Bode Law. If one began a numerical sequence at 0, then included 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc., doubling each time, and added four to each number and divided by 10, this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in astronomic units."

// "The term “asteroid” lacks a formal definition, but generally applies to those solid bodies of the inner solar system that lack sufficient mass to self-gravitate into a spherical body. Asteroids are small planetesimals or fragments of planetesimals shattered by random impacts in the chaotic early days of the solar system. Some asteroids are little more than loose collections of debris reassembled by local gravitational forces. Others are solid fragments identified by their spectra as iron (M-type); silicate-rich rock (S-type); or carbon-rich (C-type). Asteroidal densities varying from 7 (M-type) to 2 (C-type); sizes range from 1000-km to 1-m diameter; and orbital velocities range from 10 to 30 km/s relative to the moving Earth (Figure 14.10).

// ost asteroids are in orbits between Mars and Jupiter, but some exist within the orbit of Jupiter. Perturbations of asteroidal orbits by the gravitational attraction of the planets and large asteroids result in unstable and ever-changing orbits. Perturbations cause many asteroids to be in highly elliptical orbits that intersect the orbit of the inner planets. Earth-crossing asteroids with potential to intersect with the Earth are in elliptical orbits that originate in the asteroid belt and have perihelion inside the Earth's orbit (Figure 14.11)."
