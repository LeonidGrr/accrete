Accrete.rs
========================
This is rust port of Accrete - planetary system accretion algorithm by H. Dole. Various sources from github were used to reproduce Accrete functionality.

## Brief history
>Accrete's origin dates back to the late 60's when Stephen H. Dole published "Formation of Planetary Systems by Aggregation: A Computer Simulation". 
>Almost a decade later Carl Sagan and Richard Isaacson refined Dole's model -- which shortly thereafter was also implemented in FORTRAN, and again elaborately and academically published by Martin Fogg in his paper "Extra-Solar Planetary Systems".
>The late 80's came and Matt Burdick brought this priceless program to the masses (via Turbo Pascal and C). Since then, many versions of Accrete have popped up around the internet, adding varying degrees of planetary specifics â€“ the most notable (and ingenious) being Jim Burrow's implementation StarGen.(c)
